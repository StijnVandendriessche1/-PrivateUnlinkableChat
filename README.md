# PrivateUnlinkableChat
The goal of this assignment is to make a secure and privacy friendly asynchronous uni-directional message transmission protocol using a public bulletin board. This has been implemented in java with RMI as communication technology and java JCA/JCE for the crypto protocols. 

The requirements of this implementations are confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, unlinkability of events and relationships, forward secrecy and availability. This outdoes apps like Whatsapp etc when it comes to privacy since companies behind these chat apps can still make social graphs etc even tho they use end to end encryption.
